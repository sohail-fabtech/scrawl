"use client"

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The infinite canvas — pan/zoom, marquee, drag, resize, snap, create tools.
//
// Gesture rules worth knowing before editing this file:
//   · every gesture is anchored in WORLD space, so panning or zooming mid-drag
//     doesn't warp what you're doing
//   · every frame recomputes from the gesture-start snapshot, never from live
//     state, so dragging out and back is lossless
//   · modifiers are re-read continuously, so Shift/Alt can be pressed and let
//     go mid-drag the way they can in Figma
//   · the 3px threshold latches: once a gesture is a drag it stays a drag,
//     even if you come back to where you started
//   · Escape reverts to the gesture's checkpoint instead of leaving half a move
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
