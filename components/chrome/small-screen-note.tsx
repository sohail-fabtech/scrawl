// The narrow-screen line.
//
// A phone can draw on scrawl now — one finger inks, two fingers pan and zoom.
// What a phone can't do is get out of the way of its own chrome: the inspector
// is pinned to the right and the tool rail sits on the left, so
// under about 700px the panels are lying on most of the paper.
//
// This is a note, not a redesign and not a wall. It says the honest thing once,
// takes a tap to put away, and then never comes back — the canvas underneath
// still works, and someone who wants to sketch on a phone anyway is not doing
// anything wrong. A modal here would be the tool telling a person their device
// is a mistake, which it isn't; it's just smaller than the panels assume.
