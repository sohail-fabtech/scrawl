// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The file name floats at the top center of the canvas. It ducks out of the
// way while a layer is being moved, resized, drawn or dragged in from the
// library, so the name never sits between the user and the thing under their
// hand — and it drifts back the moment they let go.
//
// Only hands-on-the-geometry counts. Panning, marquee-selecting and plain
// mousing around leave every layer where it is, and a label that flickered at
// each of those would be its own kind of noise.
//
// The small line under the name is where saving speaks: a receipt after ⌘S,
// and — when the browser has no room left, or another tab has taken this
// document somewhere this one can't follow — a standing note that this drawing
// isn't being kept. It sits here rather than in the corner flash because the
// name is what the eye goes to when it wonders where the drawing lives.
