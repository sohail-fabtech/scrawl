# Contributing

scrawl is a small project with a specific taste. Pull requests are welcome, and
so is opening an issue first if you're about to spend real time on something —
a five-minute conversation beats a rejected branch.

## Getting set up

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

That's the whole setup. No environment variables, no database, no accounts —
documents live in the browser's own storage.

Before you push:

```bash
pnpm verify   # lint, then test, then build
```

`pnpm test` on its own type-checks and runs every suite under
`scripts/test-*.ts`; pass names to narrow it while you work, as in
`pnpm test crop text`. All three steps should be green before you open a pull
request.

## The easiest thing to contribute

A component. The library is just data: a `ComponentDef` whose `render()`
returns drawing primitives, added to an array.
[`lib/library/AUTHORING.md`](lib/library/AUTHORING.md) walks through it, and
`/kitchen-sink` renders every def at its default size and again squeezed, so
you can see a bad layout without dragging a hundred things onto a canvas.

Good candidates: anything in the shadcn/ui vocabulary that's missing, and
blocks or templates for screens people actually draw.

## What tends to get merged

**It looks drawn, not rendered.** Everything on the canvas goes through
rough.js. The exception is icons, which are drawn crisp — at 14px the wobble
just reads as mush.

**It matches Figma's keyboard.** If Figma has a shortcut for it, scrawl uses
the same one. Muscle memory is the feature.

**It stays low fidelity on purpose.** scrawl is a napkin for working out ideas,
not a mockup tool. Features that push toward pixel-precision — gradients,
shadows, exact color pickers — are usually the wrong direction, because the
whole point is that nothing looks decided yet.

**It keeps the canvas backend-free.** No accounts, no sync, no cloud, and your
files stay in the browser. The optional agent workspace is the one server-side
piece scrawl has, and it stays optional: the canvas itself works with no
database at all.

## Style

Match the file you're in. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the short version of how
this repo works — the map, the gate, and where the big files come apart. A few
conventions worth knowing:

- Comments explain *why*, not what. Most of the codebase's comments are there
  because a decision would look arbitrary otherwise — keep that bar.
- Components never render to DOM. They return primitives the canvas draws.
- Geometry and selection logic lives in `lib/` and is testable without React.
  If you're writing math, add a case to `scripts/test-geometry.ts` or
  `scripts/test-selection.ts`.
- Keep the top-level UI concise. Show actions, values, live status, failures,
  recovery, and consequences directly. Put non-essential explanation behind a
  delayed tooltip on the relevant label or row, keep it to one precise
  sentence, and make the same help available from the keyboard and to assistive
  technology, with tap access for touch. Use a disclosure for longer guidance.
  Never hide critical information in a tooltip.

## Reporting bugs

Include what you drew, what you expected, and what happened. A `.scrawl` file
exported with `⇧⌘S` is the fastest possible repro.
