// Getting a sketch out of scrawl: onto the clipboard with ⌘⇧C, or onto disk as
// a PNG or an SVG. All three draw the same marks — the selection when there is
// one, the whole canvas when there isn't — so the menu can never act on
// something different from what the keystroke would have taken. A copied
// selection leaves the paper out, which makes the PNG transparent around the
// marks; a whole-canvas copy and saved files keep the document's paper.
//
// The picture is re-rendered from the same prims the canvas draws, into a
// standalone SVG document. Standalone is the whole difficulty: an <img>
// loading an SVG gets none of the page around it, and neither does a file
// somebody opens next week, so two things the on-screen canvas takes for
// granted have to be packed into the document itself —
//
//   · colours, which live in CSS custom properties, are resolved to literal
//     hex against the current palette
//   · the hand-lettered font, which is a same-origin woff2, is fetched and
//     inlined as a base64 @font-face
//
// Miss either one and the picture comes back black-on-nothing in Times New
// Roman. That document used to be painted onto a <canvas> and dropped on the
// floor; saving it as-is hands over the better of the two files, since a
// raster has a ceiling — see rasterScale — and a vector doesn't.
