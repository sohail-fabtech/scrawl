// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two tabs, one drawing — the rules for who is allowed to write.
//
// scrawl keeps its documents in localStorage, which the whole browser shares,
// and it reopens whatever you had open last. So a second tab lands on the same
// drawing by default: two canvases, two copies in memory, one file underneath.
// Both autosaved the whole document over the top of the other's, last write
// won, and neither ever said a word about it.
//
// What follows is a guard, not a merge. scrawl will not try to reconcile two
// drawings — that is a different program, and a wrong guess about which
// rectangle you meant is worse than an honest stop. The bar is narrower and
// absolute: scrawl must never overwrite a version of a document it hasn't seen.
//
// Two things get us there, and the rules for both live here, pure, so they can
// be read and checked without a browser in the room — see scripts/test-tabs.ts.
//
//   planTabSync — a `storage` event says another tab wrote this document. The
//     event fires in every tab except the one that did the writing, which is
//     exactly the asymmetry this needs: whoever wrote already knows, everyone
//     else finds out. A tab holding nothing of its own catches up quietly; a
//     tab holding work stops writing and says so.
//
//   canWrite — the same question asked again at the moment of the save, from
//     the drawer's own index rather than from an event. Events can be missed,
//     a tab can be woken from the back of a phone with a whole session's worth
//     of writes behind it, and a debounce can straddle one. The index cannot
//     lie about when the last write that landed landed. A save that refuses is
//     far better than one that lies.
//
// On stamps: a version of a document is identified by its `updatedAt` and
// nothing else. The question asked here is never "which of these is newer" but
// "are these still the bytes I last saw", so an inequality is the whole test —
// which also means a clock that jumps backwards is handled for free, where an
// ordering test would quietly let the older write through. A monotonic
// revision counter would add certainty only for two tabs writing inside the
// same millisecond, which a 400ms debounce and a human hand put out of reach,
// and it would have to be persisted, migrated onto every document written
// before it existed, and kept straight through import and export. Not worth
// a field.

 * on every save already, to work out where the document goes in the list, so
 * asking costs a lookup over at most forty entries and not one extra trip to
 * storage. Re-reading the document itself to check a timestamp would mean
 * parsing megabytes of drawing on every autosave, in the single-tab case that
 * has nothing to check for, which is exactly the cost this guard must not add.
 *
 * Nothing listed means nothing to clobber: the document's first save, or one
 * whose index entry an earlier refused write never managed to record. Writing
 * is what puts that right.
 *
 * `seen` of null means this tab has never read this document — and yet the
 * drawer lists one under its name. A freshly minted id cannot be listed, so
 * this is a tab that has lost track of what it has open, and the one safe
 * answer to that is no.
