/**
 * The document as it stands right now, for the undo stack.
 *
 * This hands back the very same `nodes` map and `order` array the store is
 * holding rather than copies of them, and the whole thing rests on one rule
 * the store already keeps everywhere: **a node that is in the document is
 * never written to again**. Every mutation here rebuilds instead —
 * `{ ...s.nodes, [id]: { ...cur, ...patch } }` — settleBinds copies on write,
 * and every `order:` in this file is a fresh array. So the instant anything
 * changes, the objects this entry is pointing at stop being reachable from the
 * live document and belong to history alone. undo and revertToCheckpoint have
 * always assigned a checkpoint's map straight back into state, which is the
 * same bargain read the other way round; this is only the outbound half.
 *
 * It used to be `structuredClone`, and nothing about that was visible until
 * you pasted a screenshot in. An ImageNode carries its pixels inline as a data
 * URL — up to 400,000 characters each, by lib/clipboard's own budget — so six
 * pictures on a board meant every checkpoint deep-copied nearly two megabytes
 * of base64 synchronously, before the first frame of a drag, and a full
 * hundred-step history retained a hundred copies of pictures that hadn't
 * changed since the day they were pasted. Sharing costs nothing per checkpoint
 * and retains exactly one copy of each version anything still refers to. What
 * makes it safe for pictures specifically is that the pixels are immutable
 * once decoded: cropping is a window in normalised coordinates, and nothing in
 * scrawl ever rewrites a `src`.
 *
 * Nothing about what gets written to disk or to the clipboard moves — those
 * both serialize `nodes` as it stands, `src` inline, and a document is still
 * one self-contained thing.
 *
 * `selection` is copied because it's a handful of ids and because the entry
 * gets a second array stamped onto it afterwards; see stampSelAfter.
 *
 * If you ever do need to write a field onto a live node, this is what breaks —
 * quietly, by rewriting history under itself. scripts/test-history.ts is there
 * to say so out loud.

 * before lunch. The undo stack can tell them apart on its own — a checkpoint
 * that predates the node *is* the click that placed it — which saves passing a
 * flag down through the view and back, and saves it being wrong.
 *
 * That question alone isn't enough, though, and it took a second edit to show
 * why. The top checkpoint keeps predating the node for as long as nothing else
 * pushes one, so a layer typed into, dismissed and then opened again still
 * looked freshly placed — and the second run of words folded into the
 * placement exactly like the first, right on top of the first. ⌘Z then lifted
 * the whole layer off the canvas, and the words in between had never been
 * checkpointed at all, so redo couldn't reach them either. Two keystrokes
 * apart, a version of the drawing that no longer existed anywhere.
 *
 * So the node has to still be *as it was placed* as well: an empty run, which
 * is the only thing the text tool ever puts down and the only thing that can
 * truthfully be called part of the click that placed it. The first words are
 * that click finishing; every set after them is an edit of a layer that is
 * already there, and pays for its own step. A component's label is never empty
 * when it lands — the library drops it wearing its own default and opens no
 * editor — so renaming one is an edit from the first letter, which is what a

   * and selAfter is a third thing you have to remember on top. Whether an
   * action cost zero, one or two undo steps came down to which pair of
   * primitives it happened to compose. Dismissing a text draft you never typed
   * into cost two, with an invisible click-blocker parked between them; ] on
   * the frontmost layer cost one and moved nothing.
   *
   * So the deal is a property of the store instead. edit() takes the
   * checkpoint, runs the change, stamps the selection it ended on — that's
   * what redo puts back — and, if the document came out the same, puts history
   * back exactly as it found it. Call the primitives inside the cheap way,
   * without a checkpoint of their own; nesting is safe regardless, since an
   * edit that starts inside another one joins the one already running rather
   * than opening a second step.
   *
   * This is for discrete commands, not for the inside of a drag. A gesture
   * still takes its own checkpoint on the first move that counts and then
   * writes freely: it already knows exactly when it began, and a pointer move
   * arriving every few milliseconds is no place to be comparing documents.

/**
 * The crop flag, kept honest.
 *
 * Crop mode is on for exactly as long as one picture is the whole selection —
 * cropTarget in lib/canvas/crop is that rule, and the canvas draws the overlay
 * straight from it rather than from `croppingId` alone. Deriving it that way
 * means no path that changes the selection can leave a crop window floating
 * over a set of nodes it doesn't belong to.
 *
 * What deriving it does *not* do is end the mode, whatever the comment on the
 * canvas's own copy of this rule used to claim. `croppingId` went on pointing
 * at the picture the whole time the selection was elsewhere, so every path that
 * writes `selection` through a raw set rather than setSelection — Tab, ⌘A,
 * invert, select-same-kind, ⌘D, ⌘V, a library drop — left the mode armed and
 * merely hidden. Land the selection back on that one picture, by any means at
 * all, and the overlay came back from a keystroke; the next drag inside it
 * re-framed the picture instead of moving it. The pointer paths were fine only
 * because pressing on the canvas happens to call setCropping(null) first.
 *
 * The answer is not a list of the eight callers, which is the same mistake
 * written out longer — the ninth gets added next month. So the flag heals
 * itself: every write to the store lands, and then this asks the rule whether
 * the mode it points at is still the mode we're in. It runs on a subscription
 * rather than inside a component, because state must never be cleared during
 * render, and it costs one identity check on `croppingId` in the ordinary case
 * where nothing is being cropped at all.
