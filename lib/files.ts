// No cloud, no accounts. Clearing site data still clears everything, which is
// why Export stays one keystroke away.

// The room here is small and shared: a browser hands the whole origin a few
// megabytes, and pictures ride along as data URLs, so a few pasted screenshots
// can fill it on their own. When it fills, scrawl stops writing and says so. It
// never makes room by throwing out a drawing the user didn't choose to lose.

 * oldest first, until the one in hand fit. That is the worst trade a drawing
 * program can make: it destroyed work nobody asked it to destroy, silently and
 * with no undo, to save work that might not have been worth more. So a failed
 * write now changes nothing at all — not the tail, not the index, not one
 * other document. The drawing stays on screen and scrawl says so out loud.
 *
 * Leaving the index untouched is also the honest answer for the document
 * itself. If it has been saved before, its old bytes are still on disk and its
 * old entry still describes them — dropping the entry would orphan a document
 * that genuinely exists. If it has never been saved, there is nothing to point
 * an entry at, and a drawer row that opens onto an empty canvas would be a
