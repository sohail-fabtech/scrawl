// Arrows that stick to the boxes they point at — pure.
//
// An arrow's two ends may each be bound to a node at one of five anchors. The
// anchor is a relationship rather than a cached point: move or resize the node
// and the end is recalculated from the same side. Old documents named only the
// node; settleBinds gives those bindings the primary side they currently face.
//
// That inverts the usual arrangement. Everywhere else in scrawl the box is the
// truth and `points` ride along inside it; for a bound arrow the two world
// endpoints are the truth and the box is derived from them. `settleBinds` is
// where that derivation happens, and the store runs it after every write, so
// nothing downstream — drag, resize, nudge, align, undo, paste — has to know
// bindings exist.
//
// Route shape lives in line-routing.ts. This file owns only the two endpoints
// and what they are attached to, so changing path style cannot loosen a bind.
