// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What double-clicking a node actually puts you into.
//
// Editing should happen where the words are — same baseline, same size, same
// alignment — so the editor needs the geometry of the *drawn* run, not the
// node's bounding box. For a text node that's arithmetic. For a component the
// label is buried somewhere inside authored prims (centred in a button, hung
// off an icon, offset inside a card), so we find it the only way that can't go
// stale: render the component twice, once with the label swapped for a marker,
// and see which run changed.
//
// A card usually has more than one thing worth saying. A stat has a label, a
// value and a delta; a kanban board has column names and card tags. Pointing
// at the one you mean is the whole gesture, so a double-click carries the
// point it landed on and we work back from the drawn run to the control that
// prints it — which is the same marker trick, run once per text control. Only
// runs backed by a control count: a lorem line or a timestamp isn't a prop, so
// aiming at one falls back to the first control rather than editing something
// you weren't pointing at.
//
// Configurable icons use the same ownership rule. A component may draw several
// structural glyphs around one editable icon; rendering its icon prop with a
// marker tells us exactly which path belongs to the control, so a double-click
// on that glyph can hand the real property to the inspector.
