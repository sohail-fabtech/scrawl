// Shared by the canvas's own shortcuts and by the clipboard, which have to

/**
 * Does the canvas get to act on this keystroke?
 *
 * Only two things take the keyboard away: somewhere you're typing, and an open
 * menu/listbox/dialog whose own typeahead would otherwise fire alongside the
 * tool hotkeys. Radix portals those outside the panel's DOM subtree, so this
 * looks for their roles document-wide rather than walking up from the target.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: chrome buttons, which keep DOM focus after a click —
 * gating on those meant one tap on the rail silently killed every shortcut.
 * Tooltips are excluded too: they're `role="tooltip"`, and hovering the button
 * that advertises a hotkey must not be what stops the hotkey working.

// NOT `[role=combobox]`: that is Radix's Select *trigger*, which sits in the
// inspector permanently and keeps focus after use — matching it would kill the
// keyboard for good. The open listbox it portals in is what matters.
