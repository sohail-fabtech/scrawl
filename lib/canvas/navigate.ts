// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Getting around a drawing that no longer fits on the screen — pure.
//
// scrawl is an infinite canvas, so the day you can't see all of it arrives
// early and never leaves. Two moves answer for that: "show me everything"
// (⇧1) and "bring that one here" (Tab, and ⌘K's Jump to). Both are viewport
// arithmetic and nothing else, so both live here where they can be checked
// without a window — see scripts/test-navigate.ts.
//
// The zoom floors are the interesting part. There are two of them and they
// mean different things:
//
//   · MIN_ZOOM is where a *gesture* stops. A wheel, a pinch, ⌘- — you are
//     rummaging, and rummaging out to 1% would leave you lost on a grey field
//     with no way of telling which smudge you came from.
//   · FIT_MIN_ZOOM is where a *deliberate fit* stops, and it is far lower,
//     because "show me all of it" already told us what you want to look at.
//     A fit that quietly shows two-thirds of the board is worse than a small
//     one: it answers a question you didn't ask, and says nothing about it.
//
// FIT_MIN_ZOOM isn't zero because nothing survives arbitrary shrinking. Node
// outlines are drawn in world units inside a scaled <g>, so a 1.4-unit pen
// prints thinner and thinner until the drawing is a rumour; below roughly 2%
// one screen pixel is fifty world units, which is also wider than most nodes.
// 2% fits a board about 60,000 units across — sixty desktop screens in a row,
// with room over. Past that we clamp and say so out loud rather than pretend.
