// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Crop maths — pure.
//
// One picture, two rectangles. The *window* is the node's own box: the part of
// the picture that prints. The *sheet* is where the whole picture would lie in
// world space if none of it were hidden — larger than the window whenever
// there's a crop, exactly the window when there isn't.
//
// Every crop gesture holds one of the two still and moves the other:
//
//   · dragging a handle moves the window's edges over a pinned sheet, which is
//     what makes cropping feel like sliding a mat over a photo rather than
//     resizing the photo — the pixels you keep don't move or change size
//   · dragging inside slides the sheet under a pinned window
//
// Either way the answer is the same arithmetic at the end: where the window
// now sits on the sheet, written down as a 0..1 crop. The node's `crop` is
// never accumulated from deltas, so a drag out and back is lossless.
//
// Both rectangles are world space — where the picture can actually be pointed
// at, mirrored side included. A flip only has to be spelled out at the very
// last step, in windowToCrop, where world distances turn into the 0..1 crop
// the node stores: that number runs with the pixels, and on a flipped picture
// the pixels run the other way. Keeping the mirror there and nowhere else is
// what leaves everything above it — resize, clamp, pan, anchor — plain
// rectangle arithmetic with no way of being flip-blind. It was flip-blind at
// first, and every gesture proved it separately: handles trimmed the edge
// opposite the one under the cursor, and a drag inside sent the picture the
// wrong way down the canvas.

 * come back nearly as tall as it is wide and tower over whatever was arranged
 * around it. Holding the area means the picture stays about as prominent on
 * the page as it was: its shape changes, its weight doesn't.
 *
 * The *centre* holds still, not the top-left. The gesture that lands here most
 * often is a double-click on a corner handle, and pinning the opposite corner
 * would send the corner under the cursor the entire distance — the picture
 * would read as having fled the pointer. Pinning the centre halves that on
 * both axes, is the same answer whichever of the four corners was clicked, and
 * leaves a row of pictures sitting roughly where the eye left them.
 *
 * A flip is the one thing on the node this can afford to ignore. A ratio has
 * no handedness, and the box is resized about its own centre — which the
 * mirror holds still — so the picture comes back unbent and the same way round
 * whether or not it's turned over.
 *
 * Null means there is nothing to do: the box is already true, or the numbers
 * won't say what true is. Callers skip the checkpoint on null, so this can't
 * leave an undo step that undoes nothing — the same deal a tap with the pen
