// Pasting was the only way to get a screenshot onto the canvas, which is the
// wrong answer to the gesture everybody reaches for first. This is the other
// one: the same re-encode a paste goes through (imageNodeFrom), landing where
// the file was let go.
//
// The listeners sit on the window rather than on the canvas element, because
// the thing being prevented is the browser's default — and its default for a
// dropped file is to leave the page and show you the file instead. A drop that
// misses the canvas by a few pixels, onto the rail or the inspector, would
// take the drawing off screen with it. So the whole window swallows drops and
// the pointer decides where the picture goes.
//
// The one exception is text dragged into a field: renaming a file by dragging
// a word into the box is that field's business, and preventing it there would
// buy nothing.
