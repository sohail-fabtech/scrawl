// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What is actually on the glass — the arithmetic behind viewport culling.
//
// Every node in a scrawl document is a live SVG subtree. rough.js turns one
// component into dozens of <path>s, and the busy ones run to ninety marks
// apiece — an inbox screen is 93, a kanban board 90, a chat screen 85 — so
// forty screens on a board is somewhere around ten thousand path elements,
// all of them resident whether or not they are anywhere near the window.
// Panning survives that: it is one transform on one <g> and the compositor
// does the work. A ⌘-scroll zoom does not, because it re-rasterises the whole
// tree every frame, and that is where a big board starts dragging its feet.
//
// So the renderer skips the nodes it can prove are off-screen. Two things
// this file is careful about:
//
//   · It is a *render* decision and nothing else. A culled node is still in
//     `order`, still picked up by ⌘A, still exported — the PNG and SVG writers
//     render from nodePrims and never read the DOM — and still found by ⌘K.
//     None of this is allowed to leak into the document.
//   · A node draws in a slightly bigger box than the one it claims. A drawn
//     stroke overshoots its corners, a block shadow sits four units down and
//     to the right, and text hangs off a baseline rather than sitting inside
//     a rectangle. So the bounds get a little ink allowance before the test.
//
// See scripts/test-cull.ts — it is all pure arithmetic, which is why it lives
// out here rather than inline in the render.

 * How far past the window edge a node still gets drawn, in screen px.
 *
 * Screen px rather than world units on purpose. Culling is computed from the
 * same viewport the <g> transform uses, so a node can never arrive a frame
 * late — it mounts on the frame its box enters the kept region. What the
 * margin buys is *when* rough.js builds the geometry: with no margin at all
 * that work lands on the exact frame the node slides into view, so the
 * heaviest nodes cost their hitch at the moment you are looking at them. How
 * soon a node arrives is a matter of how fast the hand is moving across the
 * glass, which is a screen quantity; how much world that covers is not.
 *
 * 500 is about a third of a laptop window and several frames of even a hard
 * trackpad flick — enough head start that the work happens off the glass. The
 * other direction matters as much: go far past a window's width and the kept
 * region is mostly margin, and there is nothing left to cull.

 * width, roughness overshoot and the shadow offset are all measured in the
 * same units the node's box is. The PNG export pads its crop by 12 for the
 * same reason; double that here, since being generous costs one node's worth
 * of paths and being stingy costs a clipped stroke at the edge of the window.
