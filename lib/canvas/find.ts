// "Where is the checkout flow?" — searching the canvas by the words on it.
//
// Nodes have no names, and they are not getting any. A `name` field sounds
// small and isn't: it wants a layers tree to show it in, a rename gesture, and
// the quiet obligation to keep it tidy — a naming discipline, on a napkin.
//
// But a drawing is already full of words. A text layer *is* its text. A block
// carries the strings its variant controls expose — a frame's label is the
// closest thing scrawl has to a screen name, and it is sitting right there in
// `props`. And a component knows what it is: "login", drawn from a def called
// "Login screen". That is enough to answer the question without inventing a
// second, parallel set of names for people to keep in sync with the drawing.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT search, because ⌘K re-filters on every
// keystroke and a board can hold thousands of nodes:
//
//   · rendered prims. Walking def.render() for every node on every keystroke
//     would be the most words and by far the slowest way to get them — a
//     dashboard alone emits a few hundred prims. Only `props` and `text` are
//     read here, both of them plain fields already in memory.
//   · shapes, drawings and arrows. They carry no words at all, so there is
//     nothing to match; a rectangle stays findable the way it always was, by
//     being looked at.
//   · image data. `name` on a pasted picture is a filename, not something
//     anyone reads off the canvas, and the pixels are a data URL nobody wants
//     a substring search running over.
//   · locked layers. A locked layer is never in the selection, so offering to
//     jump to one would be a door that opens onto a wall.
