/**
 * The one thing a person copies to bring an agent into a canvas.
 *
 * It is a plain message meant to be pasted into any agent's chat. Everything a
 * cold agent needs is in it: where the canvas is, the key that edits it, the
 * two ways to talk to the server, and where the longer guide lives. An agent
 * that can only make HTTP requests starts right away over REST; one with MCP
 * support can add the server itself or read the guide.
 *
 * The canvas link is the plain one, without the key fragment, so an agent
 * quoting it back does not leak the credential twice.
