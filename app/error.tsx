// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The screen for the worst moment scrawl can have: a render that threw.
//
// Without this the page goes white, and a white page is a dead end — the whole
// drawer is in localStorage on the other side of it, with no way in. Worse, the
// document that threw is the one scrawl reopens, so a reload lands straight back
// on it. A retry button on its own would be a loop, not a way out.
//
// So the offer here is the drawer itself: every other drawing, one click away,
// and a fresh page for when this browser only ever held the one. Nothing is
// deleted and nothing is repaired — the drawing that threw keeps its place in
// the drawer, because it is still the user's, and scrawl doesn't get to decide
// otherwise. It is only left off the list below, so that the way out isn't
// sitting next to the way back in.
//
// Everything runs through the store's own openFile / newFile rather than a
// location.reload(): the window is wired to save on unload, and that save
// writes down which document was open — so a reload would faithfully put us
// back on the one we're trying to leave.
